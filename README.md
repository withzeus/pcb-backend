- **User Authentication Endpoints**
  - Developed API endpoints for **User** and **Authentication**.
  
    - **GET `/users`**: *Fetching user details* (Work in progress)
    - **POST `/users`**: *Creating new users*  
      - **Request Body**:
        ```json
        {
          "userName": "JohnDoe",
          "userEmail": "john.doe@example.com",
          "userPassword": "securepassword123"
        }
        ```
      - **Response (201 - Created)**:
        ```json
        {
          "success": true,
          "message": "Created user JohnDoe"
        }
        ```
      - **Response (400 - Bad Request)**:
        ```json
        {
          "success": false,
          "message": "Failed to create user JohnDoe"
        }
        ```

- **Additional Enhancements**
  - Added **TypeScript types** and **database models** for user data and authentication.
  - Integrated **error handling** mechanisms, **password hashing/encryption**, and **logging helpers** for debugging and security.
  - Updated **user DB schemas** with minor changes for better data integrity and scalability.
